Textbox using js is simple project of creating a input box, add button and then adding multiple inputs below in p tags.
First of all created a div consists of input bar and add button using html.
next added some css for input bar and button.
and then comes the js part, for applying js to our page and to make it dyanamic firstly we give id to input bar and add button.
next get those id's by using getElementById() method, and storing those ids in js varibles.
Added event Listner to the button and added "click" event and after perfoming click event we call a callback function.
